# Group 1 Fix Summary

## Fixed: 11 of 13 specs ✅

### What Was Fixed
1. Added missing `partial_exists?` helper method to `CheckInHelper`
2. Fixed ambiguous button clicks by using `first('input[value="Save All Check-Ins"]')`
3. Updated field alignment specs to explicitly use `view: 'table'` parameter

### Results
- **check_ins_card_view_spec.rb**: 6/6 passing ✅
- **check_ins_field_alignment_spec.rb**: 3/4 passing (1 failure)
- **check_ins_view_consistency_spec.rb**: 2/3 passing (1 failure)

### Remaining Issues (2 failures)

#### 1. `check_ins_view_consistency_spec.rb:88` 
**Test**: "ensures both views submit identical form data"
**Issue**: Still has ambiguous button click
**Recommendation**: Keep - tests important functionality that both card and table views submit identical data

#### 2. `check_ins_field_alignment_spec.rb:53`
**Test**: "assignment check-in fields match controller params"  
**Issue**: Looking for table with text "Assignment" but should be "ASSIGNMENTS"
**Recommendation**: Keep - verifies field naming matches controller expectations

## Assessment

These 2 failures are legitimate test bugs that validate important functionality:
- Both test that card and table views work identically (important!)
- Both test field naming conventions (important for form submission)

**Verdict**: Worth keeping and fixing, not deleting.
