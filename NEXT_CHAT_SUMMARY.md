# Next Chat Session Summary

## Current Status
We've completed Steps 1-5 of the vision document reorganization and navigation restructuring:

✅ **Step 1**: Updated RULES.md with OKR3 framework and vision document structure  
✅ **Step 2**: Created 10 fresh vision documents with OKR3 format  
✅ **Step 3**: Transferred existing vision doc content to new structure  
✅ **Step 4**: Deleted old vision documents after content transfer  
✅ **Step 5**: Simplified navigation to 2-level structure with appropriate page routing  

## Next Priority: Step 6 - MAAP OKR3 Demo

**Critical Deadline**: Monday demo to HR leader for company-wide adoption consideration

**Objective**: Get `amy_maap.md` (HR leader's job description) easily understood, navigatable, creatable, and editable using Align module concepts.

**File Location**: `/spec/fixtures/files/amy_maap.md`

**Content Summary**: Amy's job description contains:
- Growth & Development Manager Assignments (75% of eligibility)
- Multiple assignment types: Employee Growth Plan Champion, Quarterly Conversation Coordinator, Learning Librarian, Tooling Admin, etc.
- Clear ability requirements and milestone definitions
- Measurable outcomes and success criteria

## Collaboration Process Established

**Workflow**: 
1. AI provides commit message, summary, and questions
2. User confirms with "Make it happen" 
3. AI implements
4. User reviews and confirms with "Make it so" for commit/push

**Memory Items**: All collaboration preferences stored in RULES.md and vision documents

## Vision Document Structure
- **DONE**: Completed work
- **DOING**: Current OKR3 (single active OKR)
- **DREAMING**: Future possibilities

## Navigation Structure
- **Align**: Milestones (abilities), Accountability (3 sections), Positions
- **Collab**: Oppties, D<=>C, Huddles  
- **Transform**: Signals, Hypotheses, OKR3s

## What to Say to Start New Chat

"OK, ready to start, what should we do next?"

The AI should:
1. Load memory items from RULES.md
2. Review all vision documents in docs/vision/
3. Identify the top 3 actionable items
4. Recommend priority: Step 6 - MAAP OKR3 Demo
5. Provide commit message, summary, and questions for Step 6

## Key Context for MAAP Demo
- This is Amy's actual job description
- Need to demonstrate how OurGruuv can handle complex, multi-assignment roles
- Focus on making it intuitive and easy to understand/adjust
- Show vision for company-wide scalability
- Use existing Align concepts (Assignments, Abilities, Milestones)
- Authorization issues should be addressed as they arise, not wholesale review
