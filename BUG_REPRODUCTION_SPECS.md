# Bug Reproduction Specs Analysis

## Finding: 14 bug reproduction test files

These specs are testing specific historical bugs (snapshots 106, 107, 108, 110, 112) related to finalization duplication issues.

## Recommendation: DELETE

### Reasons:
1. **Testing broken functionality** - These test finalization which you've marked as flawed
2. **Historical bugs** - Testing bugs from specific snapshots that are likely fixed
3. **Maintenance burden** - These are fragile tests that break when code changes
4. **Low value** - Testing specific bug reproductions, not general functionality

### Files to Delete:
- spec/models/maap_snapshot_*_duplication_bug_spec.rb (multiple)
- spec/models/bulk_check_in_finalization_processor_*_duplication_bug_spec.rb (multiple)
- spec/models/duplication_bug_reproduction_spec.rb
- spec/system/check_ins_ui_duplication_bug_spec.rb

### What These Test:
- Finalization form submission bugs
- Assignment data duplication
- UI form duplication
- Snapshot processing bugs

Since finalization needs rework, these tests don't add value.

## Alternative: Keep but Skip?

Could mark these as pending, but they'll just clutter the suite. Better to delete them.
