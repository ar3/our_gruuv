# **Vision for all P\&E Directors**

First and foremost, all members of the Product Director Quad (Engineering, Design, Product Marketing & Product Management) must demonstrate mastery in…  
Continuously ∞ Delivering Value 💎 that Clients and Partners Love ❤️  
– and Works for the Business 💰  
– while pursuing Continuous Improvement of Daily Work 💪🏾  
– guided by a Culture of Continuous Learning 🎓

We convert strategic vision into a collection of outcomes and feedback loops that ensure – every design, every line of code, every go-to-market strategy, and every launch – has a purpose that the team feels deeply and can connect back to the mission and the product motto\[1\]. We don’t follow any one book… We combine the teachings across our many mentors and their methodologies\[3\] and our own varied experiences to continuously improve upon how we go about delivering results. Our past experiences \- both successes and failures \- have shaped our approach to leadership, particularly in our ability to balance autonomy with accountability. We are coaches not taskmasters – we empower and coach our teams to deliver results autonomously (we collaborate, we only prescribe solutions as a last resort) while holding them accountable to the highest standards\[2\]\[5\].

The hallmark of an effective Product Director Quadmate is our ability to create and nurture systems that aim to be anti-fragile, systems that amplify team capabilities, systems that preserve individual creativity and ownership – systems that create momentum rather than stifle it. We excel at identifying patterns that inhibit progress and implement lightweight processes that raise “the floor” (standards) without bureaucratic overhead (lower the “ceiling”) – constantly evaluating the trade-offs between structure and flexibility – fostering an environment where teams innovate and deliver meaningful outcomes without unnecessary friction. Systems that encourage the delivery of short-term wins\[6\] while also laying the groundwork for long-term success. Systems that emphasize the hunger for excellence by continually raising the bar for what is expected / what is possible. Our systems thinking must extend beyond our immediate function (product management, product design, product marketing, and product engineering) to encompass cross-functional collaboration, ensuring our function serves as a multiplier when combined with the others (inside and outside of Product & Engineering).

Product Director Quadmates must embody and cultivate a culture of constructive progress. Not toxic positivity ([if you cheer like a fan you’ll be sitting next to them soon](https://bsky.app/profile/ar3.me/post/3li7orbkta22b)) nor toxic whining ([we all know it’s raining, let’s walk](https://bsky.app/profile/ar3.me/post/3lcunldfjik2h))… but productive discourse and direct challenges that lead to progress. We harness the energy of the inevitable storms that arise (complaints, dissatisfaction, struggles) and – through servant leadership, judgment detoxification\[4\], and our commitment to progress – we transform those storms into actionable improvements. 

In summary, Product Director Quadmates are expected to be **outcome-focused coaches** to the coaches. We are expected to be strategic influencers using **systems** to foster continuous improvement. And finally, and most importantly we are **servant leaders** cultivating a culture of harmonious progress. We lead by example, bridge silos, and drive alignment.

## **Glossary for a few terms used above**

1. Product Motto  
   1. Continuously ∞ Delivering Value 💎 that Clients and Partners Love ❤️  
      – and Works for the Business 💰  
      – while pursuing Continuous Improvement of Daily Work 💪🏾  
      – guided by a Culture of Continuous Learning 🎓  
2. High Standards / What is success  
   1. **Individual** standards / success  
      1. **Assignments**... which will be continuously calibrating/collaborating on Assignments to ensure expectations are clear, evolving as needs change, and continuously improving  
      2. What do we rely on each other for? Are we reliable in those definitions? These are the questions that Assignments aim to help answer... but there is overall squad health, and the definition of this is fluid. If a member of a squad or an orbiter senses a lack of health, an orbiter may get closer to better understand, collaborate, and coach – and that should be on someone's issue list to be solved.  
   2. **Team** (3 definitions of success)  
      1. **Love Score** (the LS will be made up of each squad having default constellation metrics they aim for such as; applicant quality, plugged in rate, time-to-hire, onboard task completion rates, and manager actions that lead to increased employee engagement... all of these will have a normalized score so we know how we are doing)  
      2. **KIS** (Keep-Improve-Sunset is how we determine if specific features are still working for us... these should be a bit more leading than the LS measures)  
      3. **Graduation Criteria** (we launch value, not software... and value is measured by [Say, Pay, Do](https://app.getguru.com/card/idXxAqdT/Labs-Graduation-Criteria))... but the most important part of the Labs Academy? Learning. Frequency, Quality, and the compounding Confidence it builds  
   3. **Company**  
      1. The most lagging indicators of success are things like the **Big 7**. But, this is why we do all of this, and the measures above should be leading indicators that will result in these lagging indicators coming to reality.

      This is success. However, not an exhaustive list. There will be other indicators that you'll work out with your function, your squad, and your manager. However, this is the foundation on top of which everything else will live.

3. Default Product methodologies  
   1. Product Operating Model, Continuous Discovery Habits, Jobs to be Done, Lean Startup, Lean UX, the teaching within books like Sense and Respond, Demand-Side Sales, and Accelerate among many, many others.  
   2. In Q4 of 2024 in a podcast the team asked for “Default Processes”. We will call the default process Continuous Value Delivery. These default processes will live in the handbooks of every relevant Assignment and will be defined as needed. They will follow the direction hinted at in [this note](https://note.garden/ar3/note/d3eacc41-6c38-46ca-9181-baeb0ea46ce9). Stated another way, the methods mentioned in that note will begin to appear in the Assignment handbooks, but AR3’s over-corrected in his quest to not introduce suffocating processes and therefore we have not documented the default processes nearly well enough. That changes starting now (Q1 2025). We will seek to create processes that raise the floor without lowering the ceiling.

4. Judgement Detoxification  
   1. The product interpretation of the part of the vision where we say “[*make an observation and request vs simply sharing a feeling*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snxJNDAR1GbKAqAiR5U8zXTlH2bfmHEDwBbOg-RBSdE/edit?tab=t.0)” is that it is likely a judgement (and judgement becomes toxic when we act on them) if the feedback isn’t observation-based. Bonus points if it is broken into the following 6 parts:  
      1. Feedback giver’s **Intent**  
      2. **Observation**  
      3. How the observation made the feedback giver **feel** (use feeling wheel)  
      4. **Context** / guiding principles that will help the feedback giver be understood  
      5. Feedback giver’s **unmet needs**  
      6. Feedback giver’s **requests**

5. With great Autonomy comes great Accountability ([Teresa Torres' take on Founder Mode](https://bsky.app/profile/ar3.me/post/3lcqfmuwfes2g))

6. In cVd we [Dream Big and Work Small](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnpcutler_a-question-is-it-easier-to-teach-a-team-activity-7291013069399302146-dIDU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABWtagBEMHOiTdenrO8dYSB9MIB69jZp74) keeping outcomes at the center of everything  
   1. ... this means relentless iteration through working software with quantifiable results – above all else. This requires resilience, determination, humility, adaptability, and a tremendous amount of hunger. We are NEVER satisfied and iterate on everything... process and product alike. If you need the status quo, you won’t find it on the product team — things will change as we grow and we want everyone on Product to embrace that change with curiosity, flexibility, and an open mind.

7. Egalitarian [Quad](https://sites.google.com/careerplug.com/about-product/squads) Collaboration where Possibility, Usability, Viability, and Adoptability are all considered simultaneously in pursuit of real outcomes... has healthy tension... is intense... is fast... is The Way
