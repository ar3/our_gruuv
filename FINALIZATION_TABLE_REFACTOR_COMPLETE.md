# Finalization Table Refactor - Complete

## Summary

Successfully refactored the finalization page from bulk checkboxes to individual finalization checkboxes with table layout, following TDD methodology.

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The finalization page was looking for partials like `_position_finalization_row_ready.html.haml` but they were named without underscores: `position_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`

### The Solution
1. Created a failing spec that exposed the `ActionView::MissingTemplate` error
2. Identified that Rails partial files require underscore prefix in filename
3. Renamed all row partial files to include underscore prefix
4. All specs now pass

## Specs Created

**File**: `spec/system/finalization_table_partials_spec.rb`
- Tests that all table partials render without errors
- Tests position finalization row displays
- Tests assignment finalization row displays
- Tests aspiration finalization row displays  
- Tests that finalize checkboxes are unchecked by default

All 5 examples pass ✓

## Files Modified

### Row Partial Files (Fixed):
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_position_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_position_finalization_row_incomplete.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_position_finalization_row_finalized.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_assignment_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_assignment_finalization_row_incomplete.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_aspiration_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_aspiration_finalization_row_incomplete.html.haml`

### Controller Spec:
- `spec/controllers/organizations/finalizations_controller_spec.rb` - Recreated with new param structure, all 9 examples pass ✓

## Current Status

✅ **Specs passing**: All controller and system specs for finalization table work
✅ **Partial files fixed**: All files now have proper underscore prefix
✅ **Controller logic**: Updated to handle individual finalize flags
✅ **Service logic**: Updated to process only checked items
✅ **View structure**: Table layout with section headers implemented

## Next Steps (From Plan)

Remaining tasks from the plan:
1. Update existing system specs that use old bulk checkbox approach
2. Create/update service specs for individual finalization
3. Manual testing of complete flow
4. Delete old card-based partials after verification
5. Run full spec suite

## Key Design Decisions Implemented

1. ✅ Table columns: Name | Employee Check-in | Manager Check-in | Final Notes | Final Values | Finalize?
2. ✅ Incomplete items: Show in same table with colspan cell stating completion status
3. ✅ Checkboxes: Unchecked by default - manager must explicitly check to finalize
4. ✅ Section headers: Reused `organizations/check_ins/section_header` partial
5. ✅ Position table: Always exactly one row (for consistency)
6. ✅ Energy percentage: Show actual energy % from employee check-in (read-only)

## TDD Approach Followed

1. ✅ Created failing spec that exposed the missing template error
2. ✅ Fixed the issue by renaming files to include underscore prefix
3. ✅ Verified all specs pass
4. ✅ Documented the fix

The core issue was that Rails partial files must start with an underscore prefix in their filename. The files were created but not named correctly, causing ActionView to fail to find them when rendering.
