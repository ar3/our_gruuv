# System Spec Progress Report

## Current Status
**83 system examples, 26 failures**

## Fix Applied

### âœ… Fixed: Missing `partial_exists?` Method
**File**: `app/helpers/check_in_helper.rb`

**Issue**: The view was calling `partial_exists?` which wasn't defined, causing system specs to fail.

**Solution**: Added the method using Rails' `lookup_context`:
```ruby
def partial_exists?(partial_name)
  lookup_context.exists?(partial_name, [], true)
end
```

**Impact**: Fixed 1 out of 6 failures in `check_ins_card_view_spec.rb`

## Remaining Issues (26 failures)

### Group 1: Card View Consistency (5 failures remaining)
- `check_ins_card_view_spec.rb` - Form field rendering
- `check_ins_view_consistency_spec.rb` - Card/table view differences
- `check_ins_field_alignment_spec.rb` - Field alignment

### Group 2: Integration/Form Submission (9 failures)
- `aspiration_check_in_integration_spec.rb` - 3 failures
- `assignment_check_in_integration_spec.rb` - 4 failures
- `assignment_selection_spec.rb` - 1 failure
- `assignment_check_in_happy_path_spec.rb` - 1 failure

### Group 3: Finalization Flows (9 failures)
- `aspiration_check_in_finalization_flow_spec.rb` - 3 failures
- `check_in_finalization_flow_spec.rb` - 3 failures
- `position_check_in_finalization_flow_spec.rb` - 3 failures

### Group 4: Other Check-In Tests (3 failures)
- `check_ins_tabular_view_spec.rb` - 2 failures
- `check_ins_empty_state_navigation_spec.rb` - 1 failure

## Next Steps

Given your concerns about the check-in flow (which you've tested manually):
1. Review the failing specs to understand if they're testing functionality or test bugs
2. Focus on non-finalization specs first (you mentioned finalization is flawed)
3. Skip finalization flow specs per your request

## Recommendation

**Start with Group 4 (Other Check-In Tests)** - These are likely simpler fixes and don't involve finalization or complex flows.

Would you like me to:
1. Run one failing spec in detail to understand the error?
2. Skip to specific specs?
3. Create a detailed breakdown of each failure?
