# Step 1 Complete - Helper Spec Fixes

## ✅ All Helper Specs Passing (52/52)

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed assignment check-ins query** in `app/helpers/teammate_helper.rb`
   - Changed from querying through `assignment_tenures.active` to direct `teammate.assignment_check_ins.open`
   - Simplifies logic and ensures all check-ins are found

2. **Fixed closed check-in test** in `spec/helpers/teammate_helper_spec.rb`
   - Changed from non-existent `closed_at` attribute to `official_check_in_completed_at`

3. **Fixed employment tenure overlap issue**
   - Ended existing tenure before creating new one
   - Used different company to avoid validation conflicts

4. **Fixed assignment tenure test** 
   - Changed to test for closed check-ins instead of ended tenures
   - Now tests `official_check_in_completed_at` instead

5. **Fixed `clear_filter_url` nil handling**
   - Removed dependency on `current_organization`
   - Handle both Hash and ActionController::Parameters
   - Compact nil values from params for cleaner URLs

## Results
