    Signals provide real-time visibility into team health and performance through key metrics and indicators. Instead of waiting for quarterly reviews or annual surveys, signals give you continuous insight into how your team is doing. These metrics help identify issues early, celebrate wins, and make data-driven decisions about team dynamics. By tracking signals consistently, teams can maintain momentum and address challenges before they become problems.

    Hypotheses provide a structured approach to testing ideas and assumptions before committing to major changes. Instead of making decisions based on gut feelings or incomplete information, hypotheses allow teams to experiment systematically and learn from real data. This scientific approach to decision-making reduces risk while accelerating innovation. By tracking hypotheses and their outcomes, teams can build knowledge over time and make increasingly better decisions.
