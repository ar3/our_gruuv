Rather than generic praise, milestones celebrate concrete progress toward defined skills, knowledge, and behaviors. This targeted recognition motivates continued development while building a portfolio of valuable credentials. Not only is the valuable for clarity, since each milestone represents a concrete achievement that builds toward larger career goals â€“ the certification-style value of milestones ensures that growth is both celebrated and benefits careers beyond the current seat.",
