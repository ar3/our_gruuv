          %p.text-muted We help teams realize that the best way to make progress together is to be aiming at the same target. If everyone has the same expectations (defines success and failure/opportunity for improvement the same way), amazing progress can be made. The vital signs of a healthy team are these scorecard signals... that ensure everyone is rowing in the same direction.

          %h6.text-muted.border-bottom.pb-2 Forest of Hypotheses
          %p.text-muted This is how great teams operate. Every move we make is based on an assumption; "doing this will result in that". That is a hypothesis. However, many don't realize this and take actions blindly. If we are to get to a team flow state, everyone must be aware of the hypotheses they are making and those around them are making.

          %h6.text-muted.border-bottom.pb-2 OKR-3's
          %p.text-muted We communicate the actively being worked on hypotheses. We have alignment via Signals. We have true accountability via Hypotheses. Now it is time to create a new world by making new hypotheses and testing them! Some we will COMMIT to because our confidence is very high (usually this is committing to doing an Activity or delivering an Output). Some we have strong evidence, but our confidence is starting at 50/50, and these are STRETCH goals. Finally, if we want the different-style of thinking that made it relatively common to eat more hot dogs, run the 4-minute mile, and deploy 10 times per day instead of 10 times per year... we have to build a habit of stating TRANSFORM goals.
