        %h5 What is Hypothesis Management?
        %p Hypothesis management organizes the chaos of organizational hypotheses. We assume X, hypothesize that if we do Y, Z will happen, then determine how much energy to spend on each hypothesis.
        
        %h6.mt-4 The Framework:
        %ul
          %li
            %strong Assumptions (X): 
            %span.text-muted What we assume to be true about the current state
          %li
            %strong Actions (Y): 
            %span.text-muted What we hypothesize we should do
          %li
            %strong Expected Outcomes (Z): 
            %span.text-muted What we expect to happen as a result
          %li
            %strong Energy Allocation: 
            %span.text-muted How much energy we're willing to spend on this hypothesis
        
        %h6.mt-4 Key Features:
        %ul
          %li Continuous hypothesis tracking and validation
          %li Energy allocation across multiple hypotheses
          %li Hypothesis evolution and learning capture
          %li Portfolio management of organizational hypotheses
        
        %h6.mt-4 Vision:
        %p This system will provide the hypothesis management system that enables continuous organizational learning and strategic adaptation.
