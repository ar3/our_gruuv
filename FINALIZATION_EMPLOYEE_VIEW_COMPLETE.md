# Finalization Employee View - Complete ✓

## Summary

Successfully implemented the employee view to show the same table layout as manager view with disabled controls.

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Employee view was showing minimal card instead of the same table layout as manager view.

### The Solution
1. Updated `show.html.haml` to use same form structure for both manager and employee
2. Pass `@view_mode` (set in controller) to all partials
3. Updated all table partials to accept `view_mode` parameter
4. Updated all ready row partials to check `view_mode` and disable controls when `view_mode == :employee`
5. Updated submit button section to show disabled button with warning for employees

## Specs Created

**File**: `spec/system/finalization_employee_view_spec.rb`
- Tests that employee sees same section headers as manager ✓
- Tests that employee sees position, assignment, aspiration data ✓
- Tests "Waiting for manager to set" messages ✓
- Tests disabled checkboxes with "Manager only" label ✓
- Tests disabled submit button with warning ✓
- Tests no editable form fields ✓
- Tests form cannot be submitted ✓

All 9 examples pass ✓

## Files Modified

### Main View:
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/show.html.haml` - Uses same structure for both views

### Table Partials (pass view_mode):
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_position_finalization_table.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_assignment_finalization_table.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_aspiration_finalization_table.html.haml`

### Row Partials (disable for employees):
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_position_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_assignment_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`
- `app/views/organizations/finalizations/_aspiration_finalization_row_ready.html.haml`

## Implementation Details

### Employee View Behavior

For employees when viewing finalization page:
1. **Same Table Layout**: Employee sees identical tables to manager
2. **Disabled Final Notes**: Shows "Waiting for manager to set" instead of textarea
3. **Disabled Final Rating**: Shows "Waiting for manager to set" instead of select
4. **Disabled Checkboxes**: Shows disabled checkbox with "(Manager only)" label
5. **Disabled Submit Button**: Shows disabled button with info message explaining manager will finalize

### Manager View Behavior

For managers:
1. All controls enabled
2. Can select official rating
3. Can add shared notes
4. Can check items to finalize
5. Can submit to finalize selected items

## Current Status

✅ **Employee view complete**: Shows same tables with disabled controls
✅ **Manager view unchanged**: Full functionality preserved
✅ **Specs passing**: 9 employee view specs, 5 table partials specs, 9 controller specs
✅ **TDD approach**: Created failing spec, fixed implementation, verified with passing specs

## Next Steps

Remaining tasks from plan:
1. Delete old card-based partials that are no longer used
2. Run full spec suite to ensure no regressions
3. Manual testing of complete flow

## Key Design Decisions Implemented

1. ✅ Table columns: Name | Employee Check-in | Manager Check-in | Final Notes | Final Values | Finalize?
2. ✅ Incomplete items: Show in same table with colspan cell stating completion status
3. ✅ Checkboxes: Unchecked by default - manager must explicitly check to finalize
4. ✅ Section headers: Reused `organizations/check_ins/section_header` partial
5. ✅ Position table: Always exactly one row (for consistency)
6. ✅ Energy percentage: Show actual energy % from employee check-in (read-only)
7. ✅ Employee view: Same layout with all finalization controls disabled
8. ✅ Employee submit button: Disabled with warning that manager will finalize
