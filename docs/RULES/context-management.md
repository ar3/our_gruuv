# Context Management Rules

This document defines how to handle complex scenarios, vision documents, and project context.

## OKR3 Framework & Vision Documents

### OKR3 Goal-Setting Methodology
- **Objectives**: Inspire and describe how we want the world to be different. Focus on feelings, not solutions or measurable outcomes
- **Key Results**: Use confidence levels and observability types to create a 3x3 matrix:
  - **Confidence Levels**:
    - **COMMIT**: 80%+ confident we'll accomplish by check-in date
    - **STRETCH**: 50% confident we'll accomplish by check-in date  
    - **TRANSFORM**: <30% confident we'll accomplish by check-in date (impossible until someone does it)
  - **Observability Types**: See `Transform--OKR3s.md` vision document for detailed observability framework

### Vision Document Structure
- **DONE**: Completed objectives with outcomes and learnings
- **DOING**: Current OKR3 with measurable key results and timeline
- **DREAMING**: Future possibilities for discussion and debate

### Vision Document Organization
- **Core**: Authentication, authorization, communication/notification, infrastructure
- **Align--Position**: Position types, positions, seats, compensation, labor budgets
- **Align--Accountability**: Aspirations, assignments, abilities needed for assignments
- **Align--Milestones**: Observations, milestone achievements, eligibility reviews
- **Collab--Opportunities**: Good issues (specific, relevant, solvable)
- **Collab--Diverge-Converge**: Group decision-making methodology
- **Collab--Huddles**: Huddle management and rating systems
- **Transform--Signals**: Red-yellow-green team signals and metrics
- **Transform--OKR3s**: Software support for OKR3 methodology
- **Transform--Hypotheses**: Continuous hypothesis management and energy allocation

## Context Awareness

### New Chat Workflow
- **When starting fresh conversations**: Review all vision documents in `docs/vision/` to understand current state and priorities

### Project State Management
- Always understand the current OKR3 objectives before making changes
- Consider how changes align with the broader vision
- Document learnings and outcomes when completing objectives
