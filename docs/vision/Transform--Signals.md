# Transform--Signals Vision

The Transform--Signals module houses all things related to giving a team a set of signals that help them determine what part of their accountability area is doing good and what parts need attention. The basis of this is that everything must follow a red-yellow-green format. There is more to it, but we'll dig into that later.

## DONE âœ…

### **Signal Foundation**
- âœ… Basic signal tracking and management capabilities
- âœ… Signal categorization and prioritization
- âœ… Signal status and lifecycle management

## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Current OKR3: Red-Yellow-Green Signal System**
**Objective: Implement comprehensive red-yellow-green signal system for team accountability areas**

**Key Results:**
1. **Signal Categories** - All accountability areas have defined signal categories
2. **Signal Thresholds** - Clear red-yellow-green thresholds for all signals
3. **Signal Dashboard** - Centralized dashboard showing all team signals
4. **Signal Actions** - Clear actions to take when signals change color

### **Current Sprint: Signal Framework**
- [ ] Define signal categories for different accountability areas
- [ ] Implement red-yellow-green threshold system
- [ ] Build signal dashboard and visualization
- [ ] Create signal action and response system

### **Next Sprint: Signal Integration**
- [ ] Integrate signals with assignment check-ins
- [ ] Connect signals with milestone achievements
- [ ] Link signals with huddle outcomes
- [ ] Add signal analytics and reporting
