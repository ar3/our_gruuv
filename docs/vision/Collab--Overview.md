# Collaborate

The Collaborate module enables effective team collaboration through structured huddles, feedback collection, and Slack integration. It creates spaces for meaningful conversations and continuous improvement.

## Overview

Collaborate provides the tools and processes for teams to come together, share insights, and work towards common goals. It transforms ad-hoc meetings into structured, productive sessions that drive team alignment and growth.

### Huddle System
- **Huddle Playbook**: Template for structured huddles with predefined agendas
- **Huddle**: A specific collaborative session with participants and feedback
- **Huddle Participant**: Person participating in a huddle with a specific role
- **Huddle Feedback**: Individual feedback collected during or after huddles

### Feedback & Communication
- **Notification**: System for communicating huddle updates via Slack
- **Slack Configuration**: Organization-specific Slack integration settings
- **Slack Integration**: Automated posting of announcements and summaries

### Participant Roles
- **Facilitator**: Guides the huddle discussion
- **Active Participant**: Engaged in the conversation
- **Observer**: Watches and learns
- **Note Taker**: Records key points
- **Time Keeper**: Manages time constraints
