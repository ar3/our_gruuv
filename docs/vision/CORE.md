## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Current OKR3: Employment Management Security**
**Objective: Allow all employees of an organization to have their employment to be managed in a safe and secure way**

**Key Results:**
1. **100% of employment management actions require proper authorization** (using our new PersonOrganizationAccess model)
2. **All employment data is accessible only to authorized personnel** (employment managers can see their org + descendants)
3. **Employment creation/editing interface is available and functional** (the UI we're about to build)
4. **Employment data integrity is maintained** (no overlapping tenures, proper validation)
5. **Audit trail exists for all employment changes** (we can track who made what changes)

### **Current Sprint: Employment Management Interface** (Waypoint 1)
- [ ] Create new page for adding person + employment simultaneously
- [ ] Include comprehensive employment data validation
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Functional employment creation interface with validation
- **Commit**: "feat: create employment management interface"

### **Next Waypoints:**
**Waypoint 2: Authorization Integration** (Security-focused)
- [ ] Integrate PersonOrganizationAccess checks into employment actions
- [ ] Add authorization to employment create/edit/destroy actions
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Secure employment management with proper permissions

**Waypoint 3: Data Access Control** (Security-focused)
- [ ] Implement organization-scoped data access (org + descendants)
- [ ] Ensure employment data is only visible to authorized personnel
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Proper data isolation and access control

**Waypoint 4: Audit Trail System** (Compliance-focused)
- [ ] Create audit logging for employment changes
- [ ] Track who made what changes and when
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Complete audit trail for employment modifications

**Waypoint 5: PersonAccessesController Test Coverage** (Quality-focused)
- [ ] Review and implement valuable PersonAccessesController specs
- [ ] Focus on authorization, CRUD operations, and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper organization-scoped access testing
- [ ] Remove temporary `xit` skips and add comprehensive coverage
- **Deliverable**: Robust test coverage for organization-scoped access management

### **Layout Migration Progress**
- [x] Create `authenticated-v2-0.html.haml` layout
- [x] Migrate person show page
- [x] Migrate person public page  
- [x] Migrate person teammate page
- [ ] Migrate person edit page
- [ ] Migrate person index page
- [ ] Migrate organization show page
- [ ] Migrate organization index page
- [ ] Migrate employment management page
- [ ] Migrate employees page
- [ ] Migrate huddle pages
- [ ] Migrate assignment pages
- [ ] Migrate other authenticated pages

## DREAMING ðŸ’­

### **Infrastructure Evolution**
- **App Server**: Need to build an app server at some point for better scalability
- **Communication Systems**: Enhanced notification and communication infrastructure
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, database optimization, and response time improvements

### **Authentication & Authorization Enhancements**
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for sensitive operations
- **Role-based Access Control**: Expand beyond simple admin flag to role-based system
- **Permission Caching**: Cache permissions for performance optimization
- **Organization-level Permissions**: Discrete permissions per organization with inheritance

### **Development Infrastructure**
- **Automated Testing**: Enhanced CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive test coverage
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Application performance monitoring and error tracking
- **Documentation**: Automated API documentation and developer onboarding materials

### **Visual Design System**
- **8px Grid System**: Implement consistent spacing using 8px multiples (8, 16, 24, 32px) for perfect visual rhythm
- **Component Library**: Build reusable UI components with consistent spacing, typography, and color usage
- **Design Tokens**: Create centralized design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and component styling
- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure all design elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements and accessibility guidelines

### **Organization-Centric User Experience**
- **Profile page becomes current-organization-centric**: User profile shows information about other organizations but requires switching organizational context to engage with organization-specific features
- **Organization-scoped access management**: PersonOrganizationAccess management lives within the organization namespace, not as a standalone controller
- **Context switching for cross-organization work**: Users must switch to specific organization context to manage positions, assignments, huddles, and access for that organization
- **Unified organization management**: All organization-specific operations (employment, access, positions, etc.) are managed from within that organization's context

### **Public Profile & Social Sharing**
- **Customizable vanity URLs**: Allow users to create shareable, branded profile URLs for social media
- **Public profile pages**: Accessible without authentication, showing portable stats and achievements
- **Cross-organization reputation**: Stats that follow users across different jobs and organizations
- **Social media integration**: Easy sharing of professional achievements and milestones
- **Dream Goal**: Make the public profile page such that people will want to share it on their social media accountsâ€¦ ideally this page will challenge what is the center of their professional identity, rivaling LinkedIn

### **Advanced Authorization**
- Hierarchical permission inheritance across organization tree
- Permission caching with JSON for performance
- Role-based access control (if needed)
- Permission audit logging and history

### **Impersonation & Audit System**
- **Admin Impersonation**: og_admin users can impersonate other users (except other og_admins) for testing and support
- **Session Persistence**: Impersonation persists across browser tabs/windows until manually stopped
- **Permission Enforcement**: Impersonated users only have their actual permissions, not admin privileges
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear warning icons and "Stop Impersonation" options when impersonating
- **Future: Whodunit Audit Trail**: Track who took actions and whether they were impersonated, enabling "whodunit" style investigation of system changes
- **Security Considerations**: Prevent impersonation hijacking, implement session validation, and add audit logging for all impersonation events
- **Future: Security Hardening** - Enhanced validation, comprehensive testing, audit logging foundation, and bulletproof security for production use

### **Layout Migration Status**
**Pages using authenticated-v2-0 layout:**
- Dashboard, Organizations, People, Assignments, Positions, Position Types, Huddles, Abilities, All new "Coming Soon" pages

**Pages still using old layout (need migration):**
- Employment Tenures, Assignment Tenures, Upload Events, Person Accesses, Huddle Playbooks, Seats, Slack Integration, Impersonation, Profile Management

**Migration Priority:** Complete layout migration for consistent UI/UX across all authenticated pages.

### **Future Possibilities**
- **Microservices Architecture**: Potential evolution to microservices for better scalability
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for real-time collaboration features
- **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android
- **API Ecosystem**: Public API for third-party integrations and extensions
