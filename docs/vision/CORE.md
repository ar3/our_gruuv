## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Current OKR: Employment Management Security**
**Objective: Allow all employees of an organization to have their employment to be managed in a safe and secure way**

**Key Results:**
1. **100% of employment management actions require proper authorization** (using our new PersonOrganizationAccess model)
2. **All employment data is accessible only to authorized personnel** (employment managers can see their org + descendants)
3. **Employment creation/editing interface is available and functional** (the UI we're about to build)
4. **Employment data integrity is maintained** (no overlapping tenures, proper validation)
5. **Audit trail exists for all employment changes** (we can track who made what changes)

### **Current Sprint: Employment Management Interface** (Waypoint 1)
- [ ] Create new page for adding person + employment simultaneously
- [ ] Include comprehensive employment data validation
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Functional employment creation interface with validation
- **Commit**: "feat: create employment management interface"

### **Next Waypoints:**
**Waypoint 2: Authorization Integration** (Security-focused)
- [ ] Integrate PersonOrganizationAccess checks into employment actions
- [ ] Add authorization to employment create/edit/destroy actions
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Secure employment management with proper permissions

**Waypoint 3: Data Access Control** (Security-focused)
- [ ] Implement organization-scoped data access (org + descendants)
- [ ] Ensure employment data is only visible to authorized personnel
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Proper data isolation and access control

**Waypoint 4: Audit Trail System** (Compliance-focused)
- [ ] Create audit logging for employment changes
- [ ] Track who made what changes and when
- [ ] Add high-quality test coverage
- **Deliverable**: Complete audit trail for employment modifications

**Waypoint 5: PersonAccessesController Test Coverage** (Quality-focused)
- [ ] Review and implement valuable PersonAccessesController specs
- [ ] Focus on authorization, CRUD operations, and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper organization-scoped access testing
- [ ] Remove temporary `xit` skips and add comprehensive coverage
- **Deliverable**: Robust test coverage for organization-scoped access management

## DREAMING ðŸŒŸ

### **Organization-Centric User Experience**
- **Profile page becomes current-organization-centric**: User profile shows information about other organizations but requires switching organizational context to engage with organization-specific features
- **Organization-scoped access management**: PersonOrganizationAccess management lives within the organization namespace, not as a standalone controller
- **Context switching for cross-organization work**: Users must switch to specific organization context to manage positions, assignments, huddles, and access for that organization
- **Unified organization management**: All organization-specific operations (employment, access, positions, etc.) are managed from within that organization's context

### **Public Profile & Social Sharing**
- **Customizable vanity URLs**: Allow users to create shareable, branded profile URLs for social media
- **Public profile pages**: Accessible without authentication, showing portable stats and achievements
- **Cross-organization reputation**: Stats that follow users across different jobs and organizations
- **Social media integration**: Easy sharing of professional achievements and milestones
- **Dream Goal**: Make the public profile page such that people will want to share it on their social media accountsâ€¦ ideally this page will challenge what is the center of their professional identity, rivaling LinkedIn

**Future Sprint: MAAP Management UI**
- [ ] Add authorization checks to position/assignment management
- [ ] Implement disabled button states with permission tooltips
- [ ] Update existing forms to respect new permissions

## DREAMING ðŸ’­

### Advanced Authorization
- Hierarchical permission inheritance across organization tree
- Permission caching with JSON for performance
- Role-based access control (if needed)
- Permission audit logging and history

### API Development
- RESTful API endpoints for core models
- API authentication and rate limiting
- API versioning strategy
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Billing & Subscription Management
- Multi-tenant billing system
- Subscription tiers and feature gating
- Usage tracking and metering
- Payment processing integration

### System Administration
- Admin dashboard for system-wide management
- User management and bulk operations
- System health monitoring and alerts
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Performance & Scalability
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Background job processing
- Horizontal scaling considerations

### Security & Compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance features
- Security audit logging
- Penetration testing and vulnerability management

## Design Rules

### Authorization UX
- **Don't hide things**: Show all actions but disable unauthorized ones
- **Clear feedback**: Use warning icons next to disabled buttons/links
- **Helpful tooltips**: Explain what permission is needed for each action
- **Consistent patterns**: Use the same UI patterns across all permission checks

### Development Workflow
- **Small commits**: Each commit should be deployable and reviewable
- **Model-first**: Start with database and model changes
- **UI second**: Add UI after models are solid
- **Test coverage**: Maintain 100% test coverage for new functionality
- **Manual testing**: UI changes go through manual testing before deployment
