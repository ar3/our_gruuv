# Collab--Opportunities Vision

The Collab--Opportunities module houses things related to creating, curating, and ensuring the topics of discussion are truly solvable. So many teams spin their wheels because participants in a conversation are not all aiming at the same thing. So, there is a better way... to have "good issues"/"good opportunities". Inspired by EOS' issue list.

## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Current OKR3: Good Issues Framework Implementation**
**Objective: Implement the "good issues" framework to ensure all discussions are truly solvable**

**Key Results:**
1. **Specific Issues** - All issues start with no-judgement observations, personal-unmet-needs, and a proposal of a goal that would benefit the group
2. **Relevant Issues** - All issues can be traced to Mission, Vision, and/or Values; not to mention the Big 7 or some strategic objective
3. **Solvable Issues** - All issues have more than one possible solution, ensuring we're making change not pushing one solution forward
4. **Decider Presence** - The person who should be the decider is always in the room for issue resolution

### **Current Sprint: Good Issues Validation**
- [ ] Implement issue validation for specificity (no-judgement observations)
- [ ] Add relevance checking (trace to Mission/Vision/Values)
- [ ] Build solvability assessment (multiple solutions required)
- [ ] Create decider presence validation system

### **Next Sprint: Issue Curation Interface**
- [ ] Build issue creation interface with validation
- [ ] Implement issue curation and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Add issue prioritization and ranking system
- [ ] Create issue resolution tracking and follow-up

## DREAMING ðŸ’­

### **What is a Good Issue?**

A "good" issue isâ€¦
- **Specific**: In our vision we talk about how we give feedback with observations and not just judgementsâ€¦ so "good" issues start with no-judgement observations, personal-unmet-needs, and a proposal of a goal that would benefit the group
- **Relevant**: We must be able to draw a line from the issue to our Mission, Vision, and/or Values; not to mention the Big 7 or some strategic objective that is aimed at the Big 7
- **Solvable**: We use Diverge<=> Converge for many reasonsâ€¦ one of which is to ensure we have an issue where there is a possible solution. If there are more than one solution to an issue, we have a good issue because it is about making change not pushing one solution forward. We are in this to make change, not get our way

### **Decider Presence System**
- **Appropriate Decider**: The person who should be the decider must be in the room
  - If the issue is about product strategy or philosophyâ€¦ AR3 must be in the room
  - If it is about company strategy or philosophyâ€¦ Jenny must be in the room
- **Decider Validation**: If an issue comes up where the appropriate decider is not in the room, the next course of action is to drop it and have a meeting with them
- **Decider Assignment**: Automatic assignment of issues to appropriate deciders based on issue type and scope

### **Issue Curation & Management**
- **Issue Templates**: Standardized issue templates for common problem types
- **Issue Clustering**: Group related issues for more efficient resolution
- **Issue Prioritization**: Advanced prioritization algorithms based on impact and urgency
- **Issue Analytics**: Track issue resolution patterns and effectiveness

### **Integration with Diverge-Converge**
- **Solution Generation**: Automatic integration with diverge-converge sessions
- **Solution Tracking**: Track multiple solutions for each issue
- **Solution Evaluation**: Evaluate and compare different solution approaches
- **Solution Implementation**: Track solution implementation and outcomes

### **Advanced Features**
- **Issue Prediction**: Predict potential issues before they become problems
- **Issue Prevention**: Identify and address root causes to prevent recurring issues
- **Issue Learning**: Capture lessons learned from issue resolution
- **Issue Knowledge Base**: Build a knowledge base of resolved issues and solutions

### **Team Collaboration**
- **Issue Ownership**: Clear ownership and accountability for issue resolution
- **Issue Collaboration**: Collaborative issue resolution with multiple stakeholders
- **Issue Communication**: Effective communication around issue status and progress
- **Issue Celebration**: Celebrate successful issue resolution and team learning

*This module ensures that all team discussions are focused on truly solvable problems with clear ownership and appropriate decision-making authority.*
