# ABILITIES Vision Board

The Abilities system enables organizations to define, track, and certify skills, knowledge, and behaviors needed for assignments and career growth. It provides a framework for professional development that transcends organizational boundaries.

## DONE âœ…

### **Waypoint 1: Ability Foundation** âœ…
**Completed**: Core ability management system with organization scoping and versioning

**Key Results Achieved:**
1. **Ability model with organization scope** - Abilities belong to organizations, managed by MAAP permissions
2. **Versioning system** - Track ability evolution with semantic versioning and audit trail
3. **Basic CRUD operations** - Create, read, update, delete abilities with proper authorization
4. **MAAP integration** - Only users with can_manage_maap can create/modify abilities

### **Waypoint 2: Assignment-Ability Association** âœ…
**Completed**: Connect abilities to assignments with milestone requirements

**Key Results Achieved:**
1. **Many-to-many relationship** - Assignments can require multiple abilities at different milestone levels
2. **Milestone requirement specification** - Define which milestone level is needed for each ability
3. **Organization scoping validation** - Ensure assignments and abilities belong to same organization
4. **Assignment validation** - Prevent assignment creation without required abilities

## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Waypoint 4: Milestone System** ðŸ”„
**Next**: Implement milestone attainment with evidence tracking

**Key Results:**
1. **Milestone model** - 5-level system (1-5) with evidence tracking
2. **Attainment workflow** - Process for certifying milestone achievement
3. **Evidence system** - Track observations, outcomes, and other evidence
4. **Audit trail** - Record who certified what and when

**Commit**: "feat: implement milestone system with evidence and certification"

### **Waypoint 5: Observation System** (2-3 commits)
**Objective**: Build 360-degree, 365-day observation system

**Key Results:**
1. **Observation model** - 5-point Likert scale (strongly_agree to strongly_disagree)
2. **Association system** - Link observations to abilities, assignments, aspirations
3. **Feedback integration** - Both positive recognition and constructive feedback
4. **Natural habit formation** - Make observations part of daily workflow

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive observation and feedback system
**Commit**: "feat: implement 360-degree observation system with Likert scale"

### **Waypoint 6: Growth Plans** (2-3 commits)
**Objective**: Generate built-in promotion pathways and growth plans

**Key Results:**
1. **Promotion pathways** - Show what milestones needed for next level
2. **Gap analysis** - Identify current vs. required milestone levels
3. **Progress tracking** - Visual progress toward career goals
4. **Growth recommendations** - Suggest next steps for development

**Deliverable**: Automated growth plan generation and tracking
**Commit**: "feat: generate growth plans and promotion pathways"

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **Influenced by Medium Growth Framework**
- Based on [Medium's Engineering Growth Framework](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework/engineering-growth-assessing-progress-743620e70763)
- Uses 5 Cs: Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent Competency
- Subjective assessment with objective examples
- Ongoing conversation model vs. annual reviews

### **Observation Scale**
- **strongly_agree** (Exceptional) - Green star icon
- **agree** (Good) - Thumbs up icon  
- **na** (N/A) - Eye slash icon
- **disagree** (Opportunity for Improvement) - Thumbs down icon
- **strongly_disagree** (Major Concern) - Times circle icon

### **Key Principles**
- Abilities are organization-scoped
- Milestones require evidence and certification
- Observations support but don't directly cause milestone attainment
- Job descriptions dynamically generated from ability requirements
- Growth plans show clear pathways to promotion

### **Technical Notes**
- PaperTrail metadata functionality deferred - basic versioning working, metadata needs investigation
- Semantic versioning implemented (major.minor.patch)
- Organization scoping and MAAP permissions enforced
