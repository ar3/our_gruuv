# Transform--OKR3s Vision

The Transform--OKR3s module houses the software that will support the OKR3 methodology. For now we'll do OKR3s just in these vision docs to help us stay organized, but let's put our learnings in this vision doc because we will eventually create software to support this type of goal setting.

## DONE âœ…

### **OKR3 Framework Definition**
- âœ… OKR3 methodology with confidence levels (COMMIT/STRETCH/TRANSFORM)
- âœ… Observability types framework (Adoption, First-order, Second-order)
- âœ… Integration with vision document structure (DONE/DOING/DREAMING)

## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Current OKR3: OKR3 Software Foundation**
**Objective: Build software foundation to support OKR3 methodology and goal setting**

**Key Results:**
1. **OKR3 Data Model** - Complete data model for OKR3s with confidence levels and observability types
2. **OKR3 Interface** - User interface for creating and managing OKR3s
3. **OKR3 Tracking** - System for tracking OKR3 progress and outcomes
4. **OKR3 Analytics** - Analytics and reporting for OKR3 effectiveness

### **Current Sprint: OKR3 Data Model**
- [ ] Design OKR3 data model with confidence levels and observability types
- [ ] Implement OKR3 database schema and migrations
- [ ] Create OKR3 model with validations and associations
- [ ] Build OKR3 factory and test data

### **Next Sprint: OKR3 Interface**
- [ ] Build OKR3 creation and editing interface
- [ ] Implement OKR3 progress tracking and updates
- [ ] Create OKR3 dashboard and visualization
- [ ] Add OKR3 collaboration and sharing features

### **OKR3 Methodology Framework**

Based on the methodology described in [Constellation Metric's Three Categories](https://note.garden/ar3/note/c6c69503-f8a1-4e6d-9e5d-332eab9b0f16):

#### **Objectives**
- **Purpose**: Inspire and describe how we want the world to be different
- **Focus**: Feelings, not solutions or measurable outcomes
- **Inspiration**: How do we want to FEEL

#### **Key Results with Confidence Levels**
- **COMMIT**: 80%+ confident we'll accomplish by check-in date
- **STRETCH**: 50% confident we'll accomplish by check-in date  
- **TRANSFORM**: <30% confident we'll accomplish by check-in date (impossible until someone does it)

#### **Observability Types**
- **Adoption**: Did folks find the value, did the messaging resonate, is it in a place where they are experiencing a struggle moment, is the need as strong as we thought it'd be?
  - **Open**: Did they open the messaging (in-app, email, or some other medium)
  - **Land**: Did they execute on the call-to-action of the messaging?
  - **Try**: Once they've done the CTA, did they follow-thru and now are taking the actions needed for them to achieve the value?
- **First-order**: Did the thing do its job?
  - **Value**: They've tried itâ€¦ did it achieve our expected outcomes?
  - **Viability:Cost**: Is it cost-effective to operationally support?
  - **Viability:Benefit**: Does it have an impact on one of the key, but lagging, indicators such as new-biz, expansion, and/or retention?
- **Second-order**: Did the thing it was supposed to do have an impact in an area that isn't directly involved?
  - **Performance of upstream dependent systems**: For example, if you are building a reminder feature on a TODO list appâ€¦ an upstream system is adding new TODOs. Does this reminder feature have any impact on the TODO creation?
  - **Performance of downstream dependent systems**: For example, does our reminder feature have any impact on TODO completion?
  - **Return value aka stickiness**: Do folks come back to it? For example, do folks who set a reminder once, do it again?

### **OKR3 Software Features**
- **OKR3 Creation**: Easy creation of OKR3s with confidence levels and observability types
- **OKR3 Tracking**: Progress tracking and milestone management
- **OKR3 Analytics**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting
- **OKR3 Collaboration**: Team collaboration and sharing features

### **Advanced OKR3 Features**
- **OKR3 Templates**: Standardized templates for common OKR3 types
- **OKR3 Cascading**: Cascade OKR3s across organizational levels
- **OKR3 Alignment**: Ensure OKR3s are aligned with organizational goals
- **OKR3 Learning**: Capture lessons learned from OKR3 outcomes

### **Integration Possibilities**
- **Vision Documents**: Seamless integration with vision document structure
- **Project Management**: Connect OKR3s with project planning and execution
- **Performance Management**: Link OKR3s with performance management systems
- **Team Management**: Connect OKR3s with team development and growth

### **OKR3 Analytics**
- **Success Rates**: Track success rates by confidence level and observability type
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful OKR3s
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Suggest improvements based on historical data
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predict OKR3 success based on historical patterns
