# Collab--Diverge-Converge Vision

The Collab--Diverge-Converge module houses things related to, IMO, the best way to make a group decision. This is based on the Diverge<>Converge Game methodology for effective group decision-making.

## DONE âœ…

### **Decision-Making Foundation**
- âœ… Basic group decision-making capabilities
- âœ… Issue identification and problem-solving frameworks
- âœ… Team collaboration and communication tools

## DOING ðŸ”„

### **Current OKR3: Diverge-Converge Framework Implementation**
**Objective: Implement the Diverge<>Converge Game methodology for effective group decision-making**

**Key Results:**
1. **Orient Phase** - Establish context and desired outcome for all decisions
2. **Diverge Phase** - Generate multiple solution options through structured brainstorming
3. **Converge Phase** - Use chips and anti-chips system to reach consensus and take action
4. **Decision Tracking** - Track decision outcomes and implementation progress

### **Current Sprint: Diverge-Converge Interface**
- [ ] Build orient phase interface (context and outcome setting)
- [ ] Create diverge phase tools (structured brainstorming)
- [ ] Implement converge phase system (chips and anti-chips)
- [ ] Add decision tracking and follow-up capabilities

### **Next Sprint: Integration with Opportunities**
- [ ] Integrate diverge-converge with good issues framework
- [ ] Add solution generation and evaluation tools
- [ ] Implement decision implementation tracking
- [ ] Create decision learning and improvement system

## DREAMING ðŸ’­

### **The Diverge<>Converge Game Methodology**

Based on the methodology described in [Diverge<>Converge Game (best way to make decisions)](https://note.garden/ar3/note/2b9efc33-9a24-4a0b-a0f5-f944ed9d99ce):

#### **(1) Orient: Establish context and a desired outcome**
- Make everyone clear on why this is worth the time we are spending on solving it
- Observable events and a timeline are the best way to do this
- Iteration is impossible withoutâ€¦ OUTCOMES! So set what the world looks like after we've successfully completed our objective
- Don't have an objectiveâ€¦ be prepared for a bad time. Cannot skip this
- The "we will know it when we see it" or "make it good enough" is a trap!!

#### **(2) Diverge: Establish options**
- A good old fashioned "no bad ideas" jam session
- Do it quietly where folks are writing their own and share all of them with each other after the quiet time
- Do it as a chaotic brainstorm (be sure to create an environment where the more introverted actually have a way to be heard)
- Doesn't matterâ€¦ even get things out there that we know we won't do
- The point here is to get more than one solution to compare
- Without that you aren't going for an outcome, you are just pursuing outputs

#### **(3) Converge & Act**
- Play this with "chips and anti-chips"
- Folks can use anti-chips to remove options
- Or folks can split up their chips across multiple solutions
- Or folks can push all of their chips into a single solution
- The facilitator will decide how you reach a conclusion
- Remember, A Leader is / is not (modified MLK quote) â€¦ leadership is NOT gathering consensusâ€¦ it is molding consensus
- Don't get stuck or choose a new facilitator
- Do somethingâ€¦ assign todos, hold each other accountableâ€¦ solve for forever!

- **Decision Documentation**: Complete documentation of decision process and outcomes
- **Decision Follow-up**: Track implementation and results of decisions

### **Integration Possibilities**
- **Issue Management**: Integrate with good issues framework
- **Project Management**: Connect decisions with project planning and execution
- **Team Management**: Link decisions with team performance and development
- **Organizational Learning**: Capture organizational learning from decision processes

### **Facilitation Support**
