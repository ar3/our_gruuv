"For the 9 stair steps to physical intimacy, we'll use a matrix to determine the partner needs.

First three steps are DISTANT
Middle three are SURFACE
Last three steps are INTIMATE","Strongly Disagree   “Regardless of disclosure, this would feel unsafe.”
Disagree                 “Disclosure helps, but I’d still feel deeply uncomfortable.”
Slightly Disagree     “Could try to be okay / need significant emotional prep.”
Slightly Agree          “I’d probably be okay with this, if handled carefully.”
Agree                       “This would feel fine if disclosure expectations are met.”
Strongly Agree        “This would feel natural and safe within our relationship.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prior-disclosure…
• No Notification or Agreement Expected – “I desire for you to navigate this autonomously.”

• Unwanted – “I’d rather not know afterward; it would cause distress.”
• Desired, but not Expected – “I appreciate transparency but don’t require it.” - Exploring partner is willing to say yes to show things like text messages, shared location, etc

"Emotional intimacy
Step 7/9: Surface: Integration

• Connection becomes visible


Examples:
• Meeting poly-aware friends
• Ok with being publicly acknowledged
• If original partner is unavailable, the other partner satisfies ""primary partner"" roles","“If my partner reached this level of emotional intimacy with someone of their opposite sex, I would feel emotionally comfortable – given our agreed disclosure patterns (prior & post) are met.”",,,,,,"“If my partner reached this level of emotional intimacy with someone of their same sex, I would feel emotionally comfortable – given our agreed disclosure patterns (prior & post) are met.”",,,,,,,"Prior-disclosure…

• Deep interdependence


Examples:
