# ENM Alignment Typology
A 3×3×3 Framework for Relationship Orientation, Depth, and Style

## Overview
This framework helps partners practicing or exploring Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM) understand their orientation, relational depth, and compatibility. It combines Likert-based assessments (–3 to +3) with inferred logic to classify individuals and relationships across three phases, each with three dimensions.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Orientation

### 1.1 Core Openness
"If my partner reached this level with someone, I would feel emotionally comfortable given our agreed disclosure patterns (prior & post)."

Question:
- I’m good with my partner passively being open to a relationship evolving to be romantic (emotionally and/or sexually) at some point.

Same-sex: _______
Opposite-sex: _______

If either partner ≤ –1, stop (not ENM). If both ≥ +1, proceed.

### 1.2 Passive Openness Split

| Emotional | Physical | Macro Category | Nickname | Definition |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Closed | Closed | Monogamy-Leaning | Anchor | Seeks exclusivity and singular focus. |
| Open | Closed | Heart-Leaning | Romantic Non-Monogamist / Emotional Poly | Values emotional variety; sexual restraint. |
| Closed | Open | Swing-Leaning | Exploratory Lover | Enjoys sexual novelty; emotional fidelity. |
| Open | Open | Poly-Leaning | Full-Spectrum Polyamorist | Open across emotional and physical planes. |

### 1.3 Active Readiness

| Emotional Active | Physical Active | Readiness Level | Label |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Low both | Low | Closed | Conceptually curious but not exploring. |
| Low emotional / High physical | Swing Ready | Ready for physical exploration. |
| High emotional / Low physical | Poly Ready | Seeks emotional depth first. |
| High both | Active | Ready Explorer / Engaged Practitioner. |

Macro output after Phase 1:
Orientation → Monogamy / Swing / Poly
Readiness → Closed / Passive / Active

## Phase 2 – Relational Depth and Style

Measures progression of emotional intimacy (steps 1-9). Average yields Emotional Comfort Index (ECI).

### 2.3 Style Axes

Axis | Low End (–3) | High End (+3) | Interpretation
------|----------------|----------------|----------------
Connection | Parallel Poly (separate worlds) | Kitchen Table Poly (shared community) | Social integration
Emotional Structure | Relationship Anarchy (no hierarchy) | Hierarchical Poly (primary/secondary) | Power and priority
Sexual Structure | Polyfidelitous (closed cluster) | Swinger style (sexual freedom) | Sexual boundaries
Initiation Pattern | Solo Poly (independent) | Couple-Centric (shared vetting) | Exploration mode

## Phase 3 – Integration and Identity

Each individual receives a three-part code: Macro Category – Readiness – Style

Examples:
- P-A-K = Poly-Leaning / Active / Kitchen Table
- S-P-H = Swing-Leaning / Passive / Hierarchical
- M-C-F = Monogamy-Leaning / Closed / Fidelitous

Together: “I’m P-A-K, you’re S-P-H → We’re Hybrid Explorers.”

| Swing | Conflict / Closed Loop | Play Partnership (S) | Hybrid Open (H) |
| Poly | Conflict / Closed Loop | Hybrid Open (H) | Polysecure Dyad (P) |

Outputs:
- M = Monogamy / Security-Focused
- S = Swing / Exploratory Fun

## Retake and Reflection

Phase 1: Yearly or after major life changes.
Phase 2: Every 6 months or after new partners form.
Phase 3: Whenever misalignment or jealousy surfaces.

Conversation Starters:
1. Where do our comfort scores diverge the most?
2. What agreements can keep us aligned?
3. Which style axis changed since last time?
4. What does “safety” mean to each of us right now?

## Viral Prompt

"I’m a P-A-K (Active Kitchen-Table Poly)! My partner’s S-P-H (Swing Hierarchical). Together we’re Hybrid Explorers. What are you?"
