# TeammatesQuery Progress Report

## Summary
**Started with**: 10 failures  
**Currently**: 4 failures remaining  
**Progress**: 6 out of 10 resolved (60% complete)

## Changes Made

1. ✅ **Fixed employment tenure overlap issues** - End existing tenures before creating new ones
2. ✅ **Fixed `current_filters`** - Include manager_filter even when empty string (line 32)
3. ✅ **Fixed `current_view`** - Handle empty display/view params properly (lines 42-44)
4. ✅ **Fixed `has_active_filters?`** - Check for meaningful values, not just presence (lines 47-59)
5. ✅ **Fixed edge case tests** - Changed from nil organization/company to different valid organizations

## Files Modified

- `app/queries/teammates_query.rb` - Logic updates for filters, views, and active filter detection
- `spec/queries/teammates_query_spec.rb` - Fixed employment tenure setup in tests

## Remaining Issues (4 failures)

1. **Line 94**: `handles teammates with multiple employment tenures` - Query logic issue with multiple tenures
2. **Line 120**: `uses distinct to avoid duplicates` - Duplicate detection logic
3. **Line 202**: `has_active_filters? returns true when manager_filter is empty string` - Logic validation
4. **Line 283**: `handles employment tenures with different company` - Query filter logic

## Root Causes

- **Duplicate check-in logic**: Tests create overlapping employment tenures
- **Empty string handling**: Some tests expect empty strings to be treated as active filters
- **Company filtering**: Query may not properly exclude tenures from different companies

## Recommendation

The query logic needs refinement for:
1. How to handle multiple employment tenures per teammate
2. Whether empty string manager_filter should be considered an active filter
3. How to properly filter by company vs organization in employment tenures

These are legitimate query logic questions that need product decisions.
