# Step 1 Helper Spec Analysis

## Issues Found

### Root Cause
The `check_ins_for_employee` helper retrieves check-ins through **active tenures**, but the specs create check-ins directly without creating the required tenure relationships.

### Helper Logic
```ruby
# Assignment check-ins come FROM active assignment tenures
assignment_check_ins = teammate.assignment_tenures.active
                             .flat_map(&:assignment_check_ins)
                             .select(&:open?)
```

### Spec Problem
```ruby
# Spec creates check-in directly without tenure
assignment_ci = create(:assignment_check_in, teammate: teammate, assignment: assignment, ...)
# But check-in won't be found because there's no active assignment_tenure
```

### Solution Options

**Option 1**: Update specs to create proper tenure relationships
**Option 2**: Change helper to query check-ins directly from teammate (simpler)
**Option 3**: Skip these specific integration tests (not recommended)

### Recommendation
Fix the helper to be more robust by querying check-ins directly from teammate, since the relationship already exists (assignment_check_in belongs_to teammate).
