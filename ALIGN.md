# Align

The Align module focuses on organizational structure, position management, and assignment tracking. It provides the foundation for understanding how work is organized and distributed within organizations.

## Overview

Align helps organizations structure their work by defining positions, roles, and assignments. It creates a clear hierarchy and accountability framework that supports both the Collaborate and Transform modules.

### Planned Models
- `EmploymentTenure`: Links Person to Company/Position with time spans
  - `person_id`, `company_id`, `position_id`, `manager_id` (optional)
  - `started_at`, `ended_at` (nullable for current employment)
  - Validations: no overlapping active tenures for same person/company, ended_at > started_at
  - Note: Future optimization - consider caching active employment status on Person model for performance
- `AssignmentTenure`: Links Person to Assignment with time spans
  - `person_id`, `assignment_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`
  - `employment_tenure_id` (cached reference), `manager_id` (cached), `position_id` (cached)
  - `anticipated_energy_percentage` - defines "what the assignment IS"
  - Validations: no overlapping active tenures for same person/assignment, ended_at > started_at
- `AssignmentCheckIn`: Periodic performance and satisfaction reviews
  - `assignment_tenure_id`, `check_in_date`
  - `actual_energy_percentage`, `manager_rating`, `employee_rating`, `official_rating`
  - `manager_private_notes`, `employee_private_notes`, `shared_notes`

## Authorization & Security Implementation

### Current Implementation Status âœ…
- **Pundit Integration**: Fully implemented with proper policy objects
- **Employment Tenure Authorization**: Complete with `EmploymentTenurePolicy`
- **Person Authorization**: Complete with `PersonPolicy` 
- **Admin Role**: Implemented via `og_admin` boolean flag on Person model

### Authorization Patterns Used
1. **Policy-Based Authorization**: Each model has a dedicated policy class
2. **Scope-Based Filtering**: `policy_scope` for collection actions
3. **Action-Specific Permissions**: `authorize` for individual record actions
4. **Admin Bypass**: `og_admin` flag bypasses all permission checks

### Key Authorization Rules
- **Employment Tenures**: Users can only manage their own, admins can manage all
- **Person Profiles**: Users can only view/edit their own, admins can view all
- **People Index**: Admin-only access
- **Employment Actions**: Users can change their own employment, admins can change any

### Lessons Learned & Best Practices
1. **Centralize Authorization**: Use Pundit policies instead of inline controller logic
2. **Verify Authorization**: Always use `verify_authorized` and `verify_policy_scoped` callbacks
3. **Test Policies Independently**: Policies should be unit tested separately from controllers
4. **Clear Permission Hierarchy**: Admin role should be simple and bypass all checks
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Use the same authorization approach across all controllers

### Future Authorization Enhancements
- **Organization-Level Permissions**: Discrete permissions per organization (see `docs/vision_for_authorization.md`)
- **Permission Inheritance**: Company â†’ Department â†’ Team permission inheritance
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Expand beyond simple admin flag to role-based system
- **Permission Caching**: Cache permissions for performance optimization

## Implementation Notes: Assignment Tenure & Check-in System

### Key Design Decisions Made âœ…

#### **Model Structure**
- **AssignmentTenure**: Defines "what the assignment IS" (scope, energy, duration)
- **AssignmentCheckIn**: Tracks "how it's GOING" (performance, alignment, actual energy)
- **Separate models** for clean separation of concerns and historical tracking

#### **Business Logic**
- **Tenure starts immediately** when assignment begins (not waiting for first check-in)
- **Energy changes** can trigger new tenure creation (manager decides threshold)
- **Manager changes** don't affect assignment tenures (only cached in check-ins)
- **Check-ins are immutable** - never update, only create new ones

#### **Data Flow**
- **Anticipated energy %** comes from `PositionAssignment` â†’ copied to `AssignmentTenure`
- **Employment tenure data** looked up dynamically (no caching for now)
- **Check-in defaults** pre-populate from tenure data for first check-in

#### **UI Philosophy**
- **"What the assignment IS"** vs **"How it's GOING"** distinction should be clear
- **Check-in fields** may appear next to tenure creation flow for convenience
- **Energy % changes** should be obvious when they warrant new tenure creation

### Future Enhancements (Logged)
- **Employment tenure caching** using JSONB or naming conventions
- **Assignment scope validation** based on energy % changes
- **Check-in frequency enforcement** (3-month minimum)
- **Historical progression views** for ratings over time

### Phase 4: Advanced Assignment Management & Analytics (Future)

#### **"Your Job Description" Page**
- **Single-page assignment management** for employees to view/edit all their assignments
- **Bulk edit interface** for assignment tenures and check-ins in one view
- **Visual indicators** for energy mismatches (anticipated vs actual)
- **Assignment completion tracking** and progress visualization

#### **Organization Alignment Stats Dashboard**
- **Check-in analytics**: Average frequency, total count per employee
- **Assignment metrics**: Completion rates, average duration, energy utilization
- **Organizational health**: Total positions, employees, assignment coverage
- **Performance insights**: Rating distributions, improvement trends
- **Manager oversight**: Check-in frequency monitoring, overdue alerts
